<h1>Schnazzy Schnauzers: Humble Beginnings</h1>
<body>
<br></br>
<p>Welcome to Schnazzy Schnauzers -- A somewhat-biased canine store! </p> 
<p> Schnazzy Schnauzers began whenever a fluffy little brat named Viktor found me. I had a schnauzer growing up, but she wasn't very... fancy, so to speak. Viktor, however, <i>loves</i> to dress up. <br> That said, all of these outfits were designed with him in mind! However, we both think that they would be cute on any pooch! </p>
<br>Since schnauzers come in mini, standard, and giant, so do their outfits! Three sizes fit most. :)</br>
